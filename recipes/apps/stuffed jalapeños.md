### Original Text
Ok, my mom said to mix up the spicy sausage (she's used bob evans or brand, both good) and then mix in an egg to bind it... she sometimes adds some chopped onions or cheddar cheese, but it just depends what she's got around the house. And yes, brown the sausage first and then mix everything, stuff and bake in oven... probably 350 just until warmed through. Leave some seeds in if you like more heat or none if you don't.
