# Pizza Rolls

## Ingredients
* 1 pound pizza dough store bought or homemade
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 24 pepperoni slices quartered
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* ¼ teaspoon dried basil
* ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
* ½ teaspoon dried parsley
* Pinch of salt
* 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan Romano cheese in the green can
* Pizza sauce or marinara sauce for serving

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
1. Grease a 9-inch round pie pan with cooking spray and set aside.
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the pizza dough out into a large rectangle. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the pizza dough into 12 equal rectangles.
1. Place about 2 teaspoons of shredded mozzarella cheese on each rectangle. Top with pepperoni pieces.
1. Carefully take the ends of the rectangles and roll them up around the toppings, pinching the ends to make a ball. Place the balls in the prepared pie pan.
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and cook the garlic for 1-2 minutes over medium-low heat.
1. Remove from heat and stir in dried basil, oregano, parsley, and a pinch of salt. 
1. Brush the pizza rolls with the garlic butter, reserving half of the mixture for later.
1. Bake for 20 minutes or until the tops are golden. 
1. Remove pan from oven and brush with more garlic butter. Sprinkle rolls with Parmesan cheese.
1. Serve the pizza rolls warm with pizza sauce or marinara sauce.
