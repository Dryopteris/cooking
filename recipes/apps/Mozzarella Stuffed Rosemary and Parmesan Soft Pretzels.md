Prep Time: 30 minutes

Cooking Time: 18 minutes

Total Time: 2 hours 30 minutes (including rising and boiling)

Ingredients:

For the Dough:
1 1/2 cups warm water (between 110-115°F)
1 package Rapid Rise yeast
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped
4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft
Cooking Liquid:
10 cups water
3/4 cup baking soda
Fillings:
1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
Egg Wash:
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water
Toppings:
2 tablespoons melted butter (optional)
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 tablespoon fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
Pinch of salt


Preparation:

For the Dough:

Step 1: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine warm water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Let it stand for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes foamy.

Step 2: Add the chopped rosemary, flour, and very soft butter to the yeast mixture. Knead the dough on medium speed for about 12 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.

Step 3: Cover the dough with a warm, damp cloth and place it in a warm area of your kitchen. Allow it to rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

Assembly and Cooking:

Step 4: While the dough is rising, combine the shredded mozzarella and grated parmesan in a small bowl. Place this bowl in the freezer to keep the cheese firm until you’re ready to use it.

Step 5: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside.

Step 6: In a large pot or Dutch oven, bring 10 cups of water and 3/4 cup baking soda to a boil.

Step 7: Once the dough has risen, divide it into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 16-inch rope, then flatten the rope to a width of about 4 inches.

Step 8: Remove the cheese from the freezer. Place 2 tablespoons of the cheese filling evenly along the center of each rope. Roll the dough back into a rope, pinching the edges to seal the cheese inside.

Step 9: Form each rope into a U shape. Cross the ends over each other and press them onto the bottom of the U shape to form a pretzel.

Step 10: Carefully place each pretzel into the boiling baking soda solution, cooking for 30 seconds each. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pretzels, letting any excess water drip off before transferring them to the prepared baking sheets.

Step 11: Brush the tops of each pretzel with the egg wash.

Step 12: Bake in the preheated oven for 16-18 minutes, or until the pretzels are golden brown.

Step 13: Allow the pretzels to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before handling.

Cooking Note:

The boiling step with baking soda gives the pretzels their characteristic chewy texture and deep golden color. Make sure not to overcrowd the pot when boiling to ensure each pretzel gets evenly cooked. If you prefer extra crispy pretzels, you can brush them with melted butter after baking and sprinkle with additional parmesan and seasoning.

Tips:

1. Keep Cheese Firm: Freezing the cheese before adding it to the dough helps prevent it from melting out during the boiling and baking process.
2. Ensure Proper Sealing: When rolling the dough around the cheese, make sure to pinch the edges tightly to prevent any cheese from leaking out during cooking.
3. Use Fresh Ingredients: Fresh rosemary and high-quality cheeses will enhance the flavor of your pretzels. Avoid using pre-grated cheese if possible, as freshly grated cheese melts better.
4. Monitor Boiling Time: Be careful not to over-boil the pretzels, as this can affect their texture. 30 seconds per pretzel is typically sufficient.
5. Adjust Toppings: Customize the toppings to suit your taste preferences. You can experiment with different herbs, spices, or cheese blends to create your ideal pretzel.
