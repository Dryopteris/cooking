1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs/breasts
2 cloves garlic, minced / 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ginger, minced / 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
4 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine the honey and soy sauce and set aside.
Over medium-high heat in a 10″ skillet, pan-sear the chicken in some oil. Reduce heat to medium after searing the first side.
Cook them on both sides in batches until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side, or until the center is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 165°F. Drain chicken on paper towels and remove most of the oil from the pan.
Add garlic and ginger (optional) and saute for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the chicken back into the pan.
Pour in the honey and soy sauce mixture and bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat until the sauce is reduced. Flip the chicken to coat in the sauce fully.
Dish and serve hot.
Enjoy!
