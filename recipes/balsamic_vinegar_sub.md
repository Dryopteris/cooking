# Ingredients
* 1 Tbsp apple cider or red wine vinegar
* 1/2 tsp brown sugar, granulated sugar or honey

# Preparation
1. Mix the vinegar and sugar (or honey) together to combine. Balsamic vinegar has a slight molasses flavor. To incorporate that into your substitute, use brown sugar, instead of granulated sugar. As you may already know, brown sugar gets its color and flavor from molasses. Using apple cider or red wine in your substitute will help to give it some of the fruitiness and tanginess that balsamic vinegar is known for.
1. Use your substitute in place of one Tbsp of balsamic vinegar. Double or triple the amount, if your recipe calls for more. This sub is easy to scale to your needs.
