## Ingredients
* 3/4 cup warm water *See Note*
* 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 2 cups all purpose flour, plus more for kneading and dusting your work surfaces
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt (less if you only have table salt handy)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
* cornmeal (optional)


## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
1. Pour the warm water in a large bowl. Add the yeast and let it sit for about a minute until it's looking a little foamy.
1. Add the flour, sugar, salt, and olive oil. Stir to combine (I use a sturdy spatula or wooden spoon) and form a shaggy dough.
1. Flour a clean work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead the dough for about 4 minutes, incorporating any dry bits that weren't mixed in the bowl.
1. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover it with a kitchen towel (I know the bowl is dirty; it's fine.). Put the bowl on top of the stove (the heat from the oven will make the dough more pliable) and let it sit for 5 minutes.
1. While you wait for the dough, get your pizza toppings ready -- grate your cheese, slice onions and peppers, etc.

## Notes
* I always test my water temp by sticking my fingers under the faucet and letting the water run -- you are looking for just barely warm (I read once to think of a baby's bath water if that gives you a reference point). Too hot will kill the yeast and too cold won't activate it. Your packaging should have a recommended temperature if you're nervous about this
