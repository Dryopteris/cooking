***The Simply Great Cookbook*** *written by Chuck Muer himself in 1993.  And of course the best way to experience this delight is to go to the restaurant itself.*

**Bread**  
1 pack of active dry yeast  
1 1/2 cups warm water (around 110 degrees)  
1T sugar  
2 T olive oil  
1T salt  
4 C of bread flour  
  
(or try a frozen pre-made pizza or bread dough in a pinch)  
  
**Topping**  
2T poppy seeds mixed with 3t salt  
   
**Marinade (Chef Larry's Blessing)**  
1 C olive oil  
1 clove garlic crushed  
2 T oregano  
2 T basil  
1/8 t salt  
Keep the marinade in a jar in the fridge to have on hand and also use it on pasta.  
  
**Sprinkle**  
1/4 C kosher salt (or less)  
2 T poppy seed  
  
In a bowl, sprinkle yeast on top of warm water (110°). When yeast has dissolved and starts to form bubbles, add sugar, salt and oil. Mix well.  Using an electric mixer or food processor on low speed, mix in the bread flour. As the ingredients combine, the dough should become soft. If it is sticky, add a little more flour. Knead dough at medium speed for 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and elastic. Remove dough from machine and knead by hand for 2-3 minutes. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clear plastic wrap or clean towel. Set bowl in a warm place and allow dough to rise until doubled in size (about 25-35 minutes). Mix kosher salt and poppy seeds. Set aside.  
When the dough has risen, separate into 4 equal pieces. Sprinkle your work surface with the salt-seed mixture. Form each dough piece into a long loaf and roll through the salt-seed mixture to lightly coat each piece. Place loaves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. With kitchen scissors, cut loaves into 5 sections, leaving the sections still attached. Brush loaves completely with Marinade (Chef Larry's Blessing.) Let the loaves rise for 30 minutes before baking. (At this point, they may be refrigerated for up to 8 hours before baking.)  Bake at 450° for 10 minutes. Then lower oven temperature to 400° and continue baking another 10 minutes or til golden brown. Serve immediately  
For rolls, try using a cupcake pan. Spray with Pam and then spread marinade and sprinkle salt/poppy seed mixture into each hole, place one frozen bread roll ball into hole, brush with marinade to cover entirely, and then sprinkle again lightly with salt/poppy seed mixture. These will rise in about 4-7 hours. You can make the tins up at night, refrigerate, and pull out in the morning to let rise.
