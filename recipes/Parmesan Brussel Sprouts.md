TIPS FOR THE ROASTED PARMESAN BRUSSELS SPROUTS
This Brussels sprouts recipe is super easy and versatile. Here are a few tips to make it even better!

Make sure to cut the Brussels sprouts into even pieces to achieve a similar texture.
For a nice golden sear, turn the Brussels sprouts cut side down on the sheet pan.
Make sure your oven is at the right temperature for at least 5 to 10 minutes before putting the sheet pan in. This will help to lightly sear the outside of the Brussels sprouts and get the insides soft.
Feel free to add more parmesan to the Brussels sprouts.
To make this side dish more substantial you can add chopped bacon to the Brussels sprouts. Other nice add-ins might be sweet potato cubes, quartered onions, whole garlic cloves…
