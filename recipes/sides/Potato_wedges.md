Equipment
Air fryer
Sealable plastic bag (gallon-sized)
Tongs
Ingredients
2 pounds russet potatoes about 4 large potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 ½ teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon sea salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
condiment(s) of choice for serving
Instructions
Cut potatoes into equal sized wedges, approximately 8 wedges per potato. See Notes for tips on cutting potatoes.
Add wedges and olive oil to plastic bag. Seal bag and flip over multiple times to fully coat wedges in oil.
Add seasonings to bag with potatoes, then reseal and flip over multiples times to fully coat wedges in seasoning.
Preheat air fryer to 390° Fahrenheit. Once preheated, remove wedges from bag and place in air fryer basket in one single layer. Cook 10 minutes, then remove basket and shake potatoes once. Return to air fryer and cook additional 5 minutes.
Use tongs to remove wedges from air fryer basket, then serve with condiment of choice.
Notes
Cutting Potatoes: The easiest way to cut the potatoes into wedges is to take a whole potato and cut it in half lengthwise. Place the potato halves cut-side down, then cut them in half lengthwise again. Flip the 4 quarters of the potato cut-side up, then cut lengthwise down the center. Now you have 8 wedges from one potato!
You can enjoy these potato wedges on their own or with your favorite condiments, store-bought or homemade.

Recipe yields approximately 32 potato wedges, or 8 servings of 4 wedges. Nutritional values shown reflect information for 1 serving, not including condiments. Macros may vary slightly depending on the specific ingredients used.
I used a Chefman air fryer with basket for this recipe. If you use an air fryer with racks, instead of removing the basket and shaking the wedges, rotate the racks after the first 10 minutes.
As with all appliances, cook times and temperatures will vary slightly from one air fryer to another. Keep an eye on your wedges, especially the first time you make them, and adjust as needed. Smaller, thinner wedges likely won't need to cook as long as larger, thicker wedges.
