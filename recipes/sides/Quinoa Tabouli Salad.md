# Quinoa Tabouli Salad

## Ingredients
#### Salad
* 2 big bunches of organic flat leaf parsley finely chopped
* 1 c.  dry quinoa
* 2 c. water
* 1 organic English cucumber, cut into small cubes, about 2 1/2 cups 
* 4 organic plum tomatoes, cut into small cubes, about 2 cups
* ½ c.  mint leaves finely chopped
* ½ c. red onions, minced

#### Dressing
* 3 Tbsp. organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil 
* juice of 2 medium size lemons 
* ½ tsp. sea salt  
* pinch of black pepper
* ¼ - ½ tsp. cumin (optional)  

## Instructions 
#### Cook the Quinoa
1. Pour 2 cups of water into a small pot and bring to a boil.  
1. Wash the quinoa in a wire sieve then stir into the boiling water. 
1. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa turns transparent.  When cooked,  transfer to a bowl to cool. 

#### Prepare the Salad
1. While the quinoa is cooking, remove the hard stems of the parsley and wash very well.  Dry the leaves in a salad spinner then chop them finely.  Set aside in a mixing or salad bowl. 
1. Wash and prepare the rest of the vegetables including the mint leaves and cut them accordingly. Combine them with the parsley.  
1. In a small jar, place the ingredients for the dressing and with the lid secure, shake well to incorporate.  
1. Add the cooled quinoa to the vegetables then toss with the dressing.  Adjust the taste. It's a good idea to prepare it at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving for a more tasty salad.

Enjoy!
